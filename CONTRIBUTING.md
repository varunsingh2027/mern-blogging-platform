   ```

## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Message Format
We follow conventional commits:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(blog): resolve image upload issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm run test:all
   
   # Run linting
   npm run lint
   
   # Check formatting
   npm run format:check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): your commit message"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub.
